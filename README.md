To get started with the project files, you'll need to:
1. Install Jupyter on [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), [Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
2. Install Anaconda on [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows), [Mac](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos), [Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux)

## About The Applied TensorFlow and Keras Workshop
[The Applied TensorFlow and Keras Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-TensorFlow-Keras-Workshop-real-world-ebook/dp/B08Q8F55ZS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The%20Applied%20TensorFlow%20and%20Keras%20Workshop&qid=1610976724&sr=8-1&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801078153&utm_term=Applied%20TensorFlow%20and%20Keras&utm_content=The%20Applied%20TensorFlow%20and%20Keras%20Workshop) provides you with a blueprint to build an application that generates predictions using a deep learning model. Youâ€™ll learn to apply techniques to improve the model: add more data and features, change its architecture, or create a new model by changing the core components to meet your own requirements.	

## What you will learn
* Familiarize yourself with the components of a neural network
* Understand the different types of problems that can be solved using neural networks
* Explore different ways to select the right architecture for your model
* Make predictions with a trained model using TensorBoard
* Discover the components of Keras and ways to leverage its features in your model
* Explore how you can deal with new data by learning ways to retrain your model
